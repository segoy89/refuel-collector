Simple app to helps you with tracking your car refuelings. Possible to store such information like:

- `liters` - how much liters you tanked
- `kilometers` - howmany kilometers you drove since last refueling
- `cost` - how much you spent for gasoline
- `avg_fuel_consumption` - average fuel consumption per 100 kilometers
- `note` - some notes if needed
